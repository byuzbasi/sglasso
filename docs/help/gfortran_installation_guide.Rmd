# Introduction

Some R packages (e.g., `sglasso`, `RcppArmadillo`) include source code written in C++ or Fortran. To compile these packages from source, your system must have a working **Fortran compiler**, specifically `gfortran`.

This guide covers installation instructions for both **Windows** and **macOS** on one page.

---

# üîß Windows Instructions

## 1. Install Rtools

Rtools includes `gfortran` and other compilers needed for building R packages.

- Download Rtools from:  
  [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

- Install the latest version (e.g., Rtools 4.3 or above).

## 2. Verify Installation

After installation, restart your computer and run this in R:

```r
Sys.which("gfortran")
system("gfortran --version")
```

You should see version output like:

```
GNU Fortran (GCC) 13.2.0
```

> If `gfortran` is not found, ensure Rtools is added to your PATH. You can add this line to `.Renviron`:

```r
PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"
```

---

# üçé macOS Instructions

## 1. Install Command Line Tools

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

This installs essential development tools including `clang`.

## 2. Install Apple Silicon-Compatible gfortran

Go to:

üëâ [https://mac.r-project.org/tools/](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)

Download and install:

- For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):  
  `gfortran-13.2-arm64.pkg` (or latest ARM version)

- For Intel Macs:  
  `gfortran-13.2.pkg` or `gfortran-12.pkg` (Intel-compatible version)

## 3. Verify Installation

Check from Terminal:

```bash
gfortran --version
```

You should see:

```
GNU Fortran (GCC) 13.2.0
```

If the command is not found, restart your Terminal or reinstall from the correct `.pkg`.

# ‚úÖ Test Compilation in R

Once `gfortran` is properly installed, try compiling a package from source:

```r
install.packages("devtools", type = "source")
devtools::install_github("byuzbasi/sglasso")
```

---

# üõ† Troubleshooting

Common error messages if `gfortran` is not installed or misconfigured:

- `non-zero exit status`
- `undefined symbols for architecture arm64`
- `gfortran not found`

Fix: Ensure you have the correct `gfortran` version **for your CPU architecture (Intel vs ARM)**.

---

# üìå Conclusion

Installing the correct version of `gfortran` ensures smooth compilation of many powerful R packages. If you run into errors, double-check:

- You downloaded the right architecture (ARM64 vs Intel)
- `gfortran` is in your system `PATH`
- Dependencies like `Rcpp` are up to date

Happy coding! üéØ
